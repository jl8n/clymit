# Node

A node is a piece of hardware that consists of the following:

- `ESP32` microcontroller
- `BME280` temperature / humidity / pressure sensor
- `SSD1306` OLED panel

A node simply sends environmental data from its sensors to a **master**.

## About

Nodes are built using the [PlatformIO IDE](https://platformio.org/platformio-ide), and rely on [Arduino libraries](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/).
